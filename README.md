# **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**



## **Project Description**

Welcome to the **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** repository! This open-source project provides a variety of methods for implementing **Text-to-Speech** functionality in Python. The goal of this repo is to offer multiple approaches for converting text into speech, helping you choose the one that best suits your needs.

The repository contains implementations using different libraries and models, including:
1. **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** ‚Äî A simple and easy-to-use method for converting text to speech via Google's Text-to-Speech API.
2. **Microsoft SpeechT5** ‚Äî A powerful text-to-speech model using Microsoft's `speecht5_tts` from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
3. **Kokoro TTS** ‚Äî An open-weight, high-quality TTS model that provides a realistic voice synthesis.

Whether you need a quick solution for a small project or a more advanced, customizable system, this repo has you covered!

## **Installation Instructions**

Follow these simple steps to get the Text-to-Speech functionality running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ginga1402/Text-to-Speech-TTS.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Text-to-Speech-TTS
    ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended for Python projects):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
    ```
4. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## **Usage**

After the installation, you can use any of the provided scripts to convert text to speech.

### 1. **Using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**

To use Google‚Äôs TTS engine, run the `gtts_demo.py` script:
```bash
python gtts_demo.py
```

This will take a provided text input and convert it into speech using Google's TTS API.

### 2. **Using Microsoft SpeechT5**

To use the Microsoft SpeechT5 TTS model, run the microsoft_tts.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. You can use the Hugging Face transformers pipeline to generate speech from text:
```bash
jupyter notebook microsoft_tts.ipynby
```

### 3. **Using Kokoro TTS**

To use the Kokoro TTS model, open the KOKORO_TTS.ipynb Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook KOKORO_TTS.ipynb
```

This will walk you through using Kokoro‚Äôs open-weight model to convert text to speech with high-quality output.

## **Use Cases**

### This project is useful for various scenarios:

1. Accessibility: Convert written content into speech for visually impaired users.

2. Voice Assistants: Build simple voice assistant features for applications.

3. Automation: Automate audio responses for chatbots or customer service systems.

4. Content Creation: Create audiobooks or podcasts from text content.


## **Technologies Used**
   
### This repository includes implementations of Text-to-Speech using the following technologies:

1. Python

2. gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

3. Microsoft SpeechT5 (via Hugging Face Transformers)

4. Kokoro TTS (Open-weight TTS model)
